# QR Scanning

Each bin's QR label encodes its 6-character short code. The format depends on the server's `QR_PAYLOAD_MODE` setting:

- **`app` mode** (default): Encodes `openbin://bin/CODE`. Domain-independent — works even if you change your server URL. Generic phone cameras will display the URI as text rather than a clickable link.
- **`url` mode**: Encodes `{BASE_URL}/bin/CODE`. Works with any phone camera as a standard web link. Requires a stable domain configured via the `BASE_URL` environment variable.

The in-app scanner recognizes both formats, so labels printed in one mode continue to work after switching.

## Camera Scanner

Tap the **QR icon** in the navigation bar to open the scanner. Point your camera at a label and OpenBin navigates to the bin automatically.

## Manual Lookup

Type or paste a bin's 6-character short code on the scanner page to look it up without a camera. The short code is printed below the QR code on every label.

## What Happens on Scan

Scanning navigates to the bin detail page and records the scan in your history. If the bin belongs to a location you haven't joined, you'll be prompted to join. If the bin has been deleted, you'll see an option to check the trash.

## Scan History

Your recent scans are tracked per user and displayed on the Dashboard under **Recently Scanned**. This makes it easy to return to bins you've recently looked at without scanning again.

To clear your scan history, go to **Settings → Clear Scan History**.

## PWA / Home Screen

OpenBin can be installed as a Progressive Web App (PWA) on Android and iOS:

- **Android**: Open OpenBin in Chrome → browser menu → **Add to Home Screen**.
- **iOS**: Open OpenBin in Safari → Share → **Add to Home Screen**.

Once installed, OpenBin behaves like a native app. The QR scanner uses the device camera and works without a browser chrome.

# Bulk Add

Create multiple bins at once from photos. Upload photos, let AI suggest names and contents, then create them in a batch.

## Step 1 — Upload photos

Select up to 20 photos. Each photo becomes a candidate bin.

## Step 2 — Review suggestions

AI analyzes each uploaded photo and suggests:

- **Bin name** — a descriptive name based on what it sees in the photo
- **Items** — a list of individual items visible in the photo, with quantities when countable
- **Tags** — relevant category tags
- **Notes** — any additional context the AI picks up

Each candidate shows a thumbnail preview of its photo alongside the suggestions.

You can:

- **Edit** any suggestion — change the name, add or remove items, adjust tags, or rewrite notes.
- **Skip** a candidate — exclude it from the batch without deleting the photo.
- **Retry** — re-run AI analysis on a single photo if the first suggestion was off.

::: tip
Bulk Add works without AI configured, but you will need to fill in all bin details manually for each photo. With an AI provider configured (see [AI Features](/docs/guide/ai)), suggestions are generated automatically.
:::

## Step 3 — Create

Choose an **area** to assign the new bins to (or leave them unassigned), then tap **Create** to generate all bins at once.

Each bin is created with its suggested (or manually edited) name, items, tags, and notes. The uploaded photo is automatically attached to its respective bin.

## Requirements

- An AI provider must be configured for automatic photo analysis. See [AI Features](/docs/guide/ai) for setup instructions.
- Photos follow the same format and size limits as regular bin photos. See [Photos](/docs/guide/photos) for details.

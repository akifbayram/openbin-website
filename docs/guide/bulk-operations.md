# Bulk Operations

![Bulk operations](/screenshots/bulk-operations.webp)

Multi-select bins from the bin list or [dashboard](/docs/guide/dashboard) to perform batch actions.

## Entering Multi-Select Mode

### Mobile

Long-press any bin card to enter multi-select mode. A checkbox appears on each card. Tap cards to select or deselect them.

### Desktop

Hover over a bin card — a checkbox appears in the corner. Click it to select the bin and enter multi-select mode. Continue clicking other checkboxes to add to the selection.

## Select All / None

While in multi-select mode, use the **Select All** control at the top of the bin list to select all bins currently visible (respecting any active search or filter). Use **Select None** to clear the selection without leaving multi-select mode.

## Bulk Action Bar

When one or more bins are selected, a bulk action bar appears at the bottom of the screen. It shows the count of selected bins and buttons for each available operation.

## Available Bulk Actions

### Bulk Tag

Add or remove tags from all selected bins at once.

- **Add tags**: enter one or more tag names. The tags are merged with each bin's existing tags (existing tags are not removed).
- **Remove tags**: select tags to remove from all selected bins.

### Bulk Move

Move selected bins to a different area or a different location.

- **Change area**: reassign all selected bins to a different area within the current location, or remove their area assignment (set to Unassigned).
- **Move to location**: move all selected bins to a different location entirely. Requires admin role. After moving, the bins appear in the target location with their area unassigned.

### Bulk Appearance

Set the icon, color, and card style across all selected bins in one operation.

- The dialog shows separate sections for icon, color, and card style.
- Only the sections you actually change are applied — a dirty-flag system tracks which fields were modified.
- For example, if you change the color but not the icon, existing icons on the selected bins are preserved.

### Bulk Custom Fields

Set custom field values across all selected bins. Only fields you modify are applied — existing values in unchanged fields are preserved.

### Bulk Visibility

Set the visibility of all selected bins to either `location` (visible to all members) or `private` (visible only to you).

### Bulk Delete

Move all selected bins to Trash. This is a soft delete — bins can be restored from Trash. See [Locations & Areas → Trash and Retention](/docs/guide/locations#trash-and-retention) for details.

::: warning
Bulk delete moves all selected bins to Trash at once. Double-check your selection before confirming. Bins with private visibility set by other users cannot be bulk-deleted unless you are an admin.

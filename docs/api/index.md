# API Overview

OpenBin exposes a REST API under `/api`. The full OpenAPI 3.0 spec is at
[`server/openapi.yaml`](https://github.com/akifbayram/openbin/blob/main/server/openapi.yaml) in the repository.

## Base URL

| Environment | URL |
|---|---|
| Docker (default) | `http://localhost:1453/api` |
| Local development | `http://localhost:1453/api` |
| Production | `https://your-domain.com/api` |

## Authentication

Three authentication methods are supported. Use the one that fits your use case.

### 1. httpOnly Cookies (browser sessions)

This is the primary authentication method used by the OpenBin web app. On a successful login or registration, the server sets two httpOnly cookies:

- `openbin-access` — short-lived JWT access token (15-minute expiry)
- `openbin-refresh` — long-lived refresh token (7-day expiry)

Browsers automatically include these cookies on every same-origin request. Cross-origin requests must include `credentials: 'include'`. The refresh token is rotated automatically via `POST /api/auth/refresh`. If a revoked refresh token is replayed, the entire token family is invalidated as a security measure.

### 2. Bearer Token (JWT)

The JWT token returned in the `token` field of the login and register response body can be used directly as a Bearer token:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <jwt-token>
```

This method is provided for backward compatibility and for clients that cannot use cookies.

### 3. API Key

Long-lived API keys (format: `sk_openbin_<64 hex chars>`) can be created via `POST /api/api-keys` and used in the same Authorization header format:

```http
Authorization: Bearer sk_openbin_...
```

API keys are per-user, not per-location. A single key works across all locations the user belongs to. They are intended for automation, scripts, and integrations such as smart home systems. They never expire unless explicitly revoked. See the [API Keys guide](/docs/guide/api-keys) for details on creating and managing keys.

## Response Envelopes

### List responses

All list endpoints return a consistent envelope:

```json
{
  "results": [...],
  "count": 42
}
```

When pagination is used (i.e., a `limit` query parameter is provided), `count` reflects the **total number of matching rows** across all pages. Without pagination, `count` equals `results.length`.

### Error responses

All errors use a consistent envelope with a machine-readable code and a human-readable message:

```json
{
  "error": "NOT_FOUND",
  "message": "Bin not found"
}
```

| Error Code | HTTP Status | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `VALIDATION_ERROR` | 422 | Request body or parameters failed validation |
| `NOT_FOUND` | 404 | The requested resource does not exist |
| `FORBIDDEN` | 401 / 403 | Authentication required or insufficient permissions |
| `GONE` | 410 | Resource has been deleted |
| `CONFLICT` | 409 | Resource already exists (e.g. duplicate username) |
| `RATE_LIMITED` | 429 | Too many requests — back off and retry |
| `INTERNAL_ERROR` | 500 | Unexpected server error |

## Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is applied to sensitive endpoints to prevent abuse:

- **Registration** (`POST /auth/register`): 3 attempts per hour
- **Login** (`POST /auth/login`): 5 attempts per 15 minutes
- **Token refresh** (`POST /auth/refresh`): limited per IP
- **Join location** (`POST /locations/join`): 10 per 15 minutes
- **AI endpoints**: 30 per hour for JWT auth; higher limits for API keys
- **Batch operations**: 60 per hour for JWT; 600 per hour for API keys

::: tip Development
Set the `DISABLE_RATE_LIMIT=true` environment variable to disable all rate limiters during local development and testing.

::: tip Getting Started with the API
To use the API programmatically, create an API key in the OpenBin UI. See the [API Keys guide](/docs/guide/api-keys) for setup instructions.
